🚨 STOP CONDITION (GLOBAL)
If you encounter:

- Missing invariants
- Conflicting truths (code vs docs)
- Security ambiguity
- Irreversible data risk
- Missing official documentation

STOP immediately.
Escalate to the user.
Do NOT guess. Do NOT proceed.
📚 SOURCE OF TRUTH ORDER (Highest → Lowest)

1. Running code + DB schema
2. Migrations / versioned configs
3. Official external documentation
4. Repo documentation
5. Prior chat context
6. Assumptions (must be declared explicitly)

⚠️ OPTIMIZATION GUARD
Do NOT optimize for performance, elegance, reuse, or abstraction
unless explicitly requested.
Correctness + trust come first.
