# Validation & Review (EPIC-D)

This document will contain the locked validation rules, acceptance criteria for LOCKED lessons, partial regeneration policy, and reviewer SOP required by EPIC-D feature D7.

Sections to add:

- Machine-checkable invariants (completeness, difficulty enum alignment, lab linkage presence, source grounding %)
- Acceptance criteria thresholds and concrete pass/fail examples
- Partial regeneration policy and invariants to preserve (metadata, review flags)
- CI invocation and test runner guidance (example steps)
- Reviewer SOP: one-page checklist and change-log format

NOTE: This is a placeholder created by Docs Gatekeeper. Version pins for JSON Schema, Node, and test frameworks must be added before implementation.
