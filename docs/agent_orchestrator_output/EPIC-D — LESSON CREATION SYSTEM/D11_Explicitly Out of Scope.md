RESULT: NO AGENT EXECUTION REQUIRED
REASON: Features D11.59–62 enumerate capabilities explicitly excluded from EPIC-D (adaptive learning, user-generated lessons, ratings/comments, AI-decided difficulty). These are product decisions to remain out-of-scope; no agent work is required as part of the EPIC-D deliverables unless policy changes.
