## Global Versioning Rule

- Runtime tools that affect execution, caching, or CI determinism MUST be pinned.
- Specification-only tools (syntax, matching, resolution rules) MUST NOT be pinned unless the upstream spec guarantees stability.
- BLOCKED indicates intentional non-decision due to insufficient authoritative version guarantees.
