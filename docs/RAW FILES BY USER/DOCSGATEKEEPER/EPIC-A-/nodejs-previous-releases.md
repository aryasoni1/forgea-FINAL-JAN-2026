Node.js Releases
Commercial support for versions past the Maintenance LTS phase is available through our OpenJS Ecosystem Sustainability Program partners
Major Node.js versions enter Current release status for six months, which gives library authors time to add support for them. After six months, odd-numbered releases (9, 11, etc.) become unsupported, and even-numbered releases (10, 12, etc.) move to Active LTS status and are ready for general use. LTS release status is "long-term support", which typically guarantees that critical bugs will be fixed for a total of 30 months. Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases.

Official vs. Community Installation Methods
The Node.js website provides several non-interactive installation methods, including command-line interfaces (CLIs), operating system (OS) package managers (e.g., brew), and Node.js version managers (e.g., nvm).

To highlight and promote community contributions, the Node.js project introduced a revised Downloads page categorizing installation methods as either “Official” or “Community.” This provides users with increased flexibility and choice. To ensure clarity, we’ve defined criteria for each category.

Official Installation Methods
Installation methods designated as “Official” must meet the following requirements:

Requirements (Official Installation Methods)
New Node.js releases must be available simultaneously with the official release.
Project maintainers must have a close relationship with the Node.js project, including direct communication channels.
Installation method must download official binaries bundled by the Node.js project.
Installation method must not build from source when pre-built binaries are available, nor should it alter the official binaries.
Community Installation Methods
Community installation methods included on the self-service download page (located at /download) must also adhere to a minimum set of criteria:

Version Support: Must support all currently supported, non-End-of-Life (EOL) Node.js versions.
OS Compatibility: Must function on at least one officially supported Operating System (OS).
Broad OS Support: Cannot be limited to a subset of OS distributions or versions.
For example, an installation method claiming compatibility with “Windows” must function on “Windows 10”, “Windows 11”, and all their editions (including server versions).
Similarly, an installation method claiming compatibility with “Linux” must be installable on all major Linux distributions, not just a specific subset. It cannot rely on distribution-specific package managers like apt or dnf.
Free and Open Source: Must be free to use and open source, must not be sold as a commercial product, and must not be a paid service.
