# Prettier

- Category: Formatting
- Epics: A, K
- Version / Requirement: Pin required
- Intent / Critical Decision: Formatting-only enforcement to avoid style drift.

## EPIC-A — Notes

- Mentioned in: EPIC-A — MONOREPO & DEVELOPER TOOLING FOUNDATION
- EPIC-A intent: Formatting-only policy with a pinned Prettier version and CI `--check` enforcement to prevent drift.
- Important points: Pin Prettier in `devDependencies`, add canonical `.prettierrc` to repo, and include CI check examples in docs.
