# RFC 7234

- Category: HTTP
- Epics: G, J
- Version / Requirement: RFC 7234
- Intent / Critical Decision: HTTP caching semantics for preview and lesson assets.

## EPIC-G — Notes

- Mentioned in: EPIC-G — PUSH FLOW & SNAPSHOT PREVIEW
- EPIC-G intent: Define caching behavior for immutable snapshots and ephemeral previews (TTL, ETag, purge) used by the preview hosting flow.
- Important points:
  - Use RFC 7234 to justify CDN TTL choices for snapshot assets (immutable) vs previews (short-lived), and document `Cache-Control` templates for both.
  - Recommend `ETag` and content-addressed URLs for immutable snapshots to enable long TTLs and safe CDN caching.
  - Define purge/invalidation strategies for preview content and ensure acceptance tests demonstrate expected cache invalidation behavior.
