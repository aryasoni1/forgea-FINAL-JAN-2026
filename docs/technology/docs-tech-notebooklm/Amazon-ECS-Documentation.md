Would you like me to generate a similar list for a different AWS service, or perhaps provide the links for a specific version of the documentation?
You’re right to double-check—I previously provided a summarized list of major categories. Since NotebookLM works best when it has the **exact, individual pages** to crawl, here is the exhaustive list of every specific sub-link found in that sidebar section, converted to absolute URLs for your research.
