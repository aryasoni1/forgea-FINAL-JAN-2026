### FEATURE CONTEXT

- Epic: EPIC-D — LESSON CREATION SYSTEM
- Feature: D11 — Explicitly Out of Scope
- Source: /docs/agent_orchestrator_output/EPIC-D — LESSON CREATION SYSTEM/D11_Explicitly Out of Scope.md and /docs/tasks/master_tasks_V1/EPIC-D — LESSON CREATION SYSTEM.MD

### TASKS CHECKED

- D11.59 — Exclude adaptive learning
- D11.60 — Exclude user-generated lessons
- D11.61 — Exclude ratings and comments
- D11.62 — Exclude AI-decided difficulty

### WHAT ALREADY EXISTS

- /docs/agent_orchestrator_output/EPIC-D — LESSON CREATION SYSTEM/D11_Explicitly Out of Scope.md — orchestrator result stating: NO AGENT EXECUTION REQUIRED and listing the excluded capabilities (59–62).
- /docs/tasks/master_tasks_V1/EPIC-D — LESSON CREATION SYSTEM.MD — EPIC master task list includes items 59–62 under "Explicitly Out of Scope".

### WHAT IS PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

- None — the orchestrator explicitly marks these items as out-of-scope and no implementation or design artifacts were produced or required.

### WHAT IS MISSING

- No implementation artifacts are expected or required; therefore nothing is missing relative to the orchestrator decision. If the product scope changes, new artifacts and a planner brief will be required.

### RISKS OR CONFLICTS

- No code impact observed in the repository for these excluded features. The only risk is procedural: if product policy changes later, work will be needed and should be re-opened via the planner-architect.

### QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION

- None required. The orchestrator decision is explicit.

### NEXT AGENT HANDOFF PROMPT (MANDATORY)

Copy-paste-ready prompt for the next agent (no-op / archive confirmation):

"You are the next agent receiving this code-scout report for EPIC-D FEATURE D11 — Explicitly Out of Scope. Input: this report (`/docs/code-scout/EPIC-D — LESSON CREATION SYSTEM/D11_Explicitly Out of Scope.md`) and the orchestrator brief (`/docs/agent_orchestrator_output/EPIC-D — LESSON CREATION SYSTEM/D11_Explicitly Out of Scope.md`). Task: Confirm that no agent execution is required and archive/mark this feature as closed in the tracking system. If product scope or policy changes later, reopen the task and reference this report. Do not implement code or design artifacts."

Handoff complete. Provide this report verbatim to the next agent.
